# Terraform Beginner Bootcamp 2023 - Week 1

## Fixing Tags

[How to Delete Local and Remote Tags on Git](https://devconnected.com/how-to-delete-local-and-remote-tags-on-git/)

Locall delete a tag
```sh
git tag -d <tag_name>
```

Remotely delete tag

```sh
git push --delete origin tagname
```

Checkout the commit that you want to retag. Grab the sha from your Github history.

```sh
git checkout <SHA>
git tag M.M.P
git push --tags
git checkout main
```

## Root Module Structure

Our root module structure is as follows:

```
PROJECT_ROOT
│
├── main.tf                 # everything else.
├── variables.tf            # stores the structure of input variables
├── terraform.tfvars        # the data of variables we want to load into our terraform project
├── providers.tf            # defined required providers and their configuration
├── outputs.tf              # stores our outputs
└── README.md               # required for root modules
```

## Terraform and Input Variables

### Terraform Cloud Variables

In terraform we can set two kind of variables:
- Enviroment Variables - those you would set in your bash terminal eg. AWS credentials
- Terraform Variables - those that you would normally set in your tfvars file

We can set Terraform Cloud variables to be sensitive so they are not shown visibliy in the UI.

### Loading Terraform Input Variables

[Terraform Input Variables](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables)

### `var` flag
We can use the `-var` flag to set an input variable or override a variable in the tfvars file eg. `terraform -var user_ud="my-user_id"`

### `var-file` Flag

The `var-file` flag in Terraform allows you to specify an external file containing variable definitions. It's used with Terraform commands like `terraform apply` or `terraform plan` to separate sensitive or frequently changing variables from your main configuration.

Example usage:

```shell
terraform apply -var-file=my-vars.tfvars
```


### `auto.tfvars`

```markdown

The `auto.tfvars` file is recognized by Terraform and automatically loads variable values without needing the `-var-file` flag. It's useful for setting default variable values.

1. Terraform checks for `auto.tfvars` in the same directory as your main configuration.
2. Variable values defined in `auto.tfvars` are automatically loaded.
3. Unspecified variables prompt interactive input.
```


### terraform.tvfars

This is the default file to load in terraform variables in bulk

## Dealing With Configuration Drift

## What happens if we lose our state file?

If you lose your statefile, you most likley have to tear down all your cloud infrastructure manually.

You can use terraform port but it won't for all cloud resources. You need check the terraform providers documentation for which resources support import.

### Fix Missing Resources with Terraform Import

`terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name`

[Terraform Import](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/import)
[AWS S3 Bucket Import](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/s3_bucket#import)

### Fix Manual Configuration

If someone goes and delete or modifies cloud resource manually through ClickOps. 

If we run Terraform plan is with attempt to put our infrstraucture back into the expected state fixing Configuration Drift

## Fix using Terraform Refresh

```sh
terraform apply -refresh-only -auto-approve
```
